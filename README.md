# Phishing-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

I developed a web app ready to be hosted on the internet for everyone's usage.

Talking about the web app:
1. Refering to the article: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00327/Phishing%20Websites%20Features.docx, one can understand the main features that can be used for the purpose of phishing website detection
2. Different datasets are available, we have used the one generated by the courtesy of Alexa, which classifies the website on different features. Denoting suspicious as 0, dangerous as -1 and safe as 1, we can segragate the features from the label and select useful features as well if needed out of all the features.
3. Using these features, we train the Random Forest Classifier which will be used for classifying the website
4. Using the PhishTank, one can verify whether the Classifier is working great against new website URL
5. Besides the detection functionality, the front-end of the web app has also been created. 
6. Lastly, the app can be deployed by building the image using the Dockerfile, and pushing it on the Dockerhub then can be used in Cloud Run or AWS EC2.
